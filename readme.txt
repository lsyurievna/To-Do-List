In this project, I learnt the basics of JS. Specifically, methods like addEventListener, getElementByID.
How to improve on the project:
1) make so that the button presses when I click Enter.
2) introduce calendar
3) automatically put tasks not completed during the current day, onto the next, and so on
4) introduce functionality where I can manually drag tasks from one day to another
5) improve on the looks (not necessary, functionality is the most important for the client)
